# LA Crime Database
This webapp aims to give insights on the LA Crime database from 2020. It will allow users to report crimes as well as view any crimes based on key factors such as location, victim age, or even crime type. Additionally, this will be useful to users who are concerned about living near dangerous areas, for example, while a specific neighborhood might be very safe the user could be interested in knowing that just a couple miles down the road is a very dangerous area. This tool is designed for people looking at a specific neighborhood or location and gives them valuable information before they decide to buy a house or open a business in that location.
